# CodeAlpha_Hotel-Reservation-System
This Java program is a Hotel Reservation System using OOP and ArrayLists. It lets users view rooms, book, cancel, and see reservations. Each booking generates a receipt with date/time, and cancellations create a slip with refund details. Data is also saved to files so records persist after closing.
